Changes I made in the gutenberg html files
=================
I changed the img tags so that the source of the image is in my Images directory. I also changed the name of the images since cover was used for all three images.
I also removed all of the css from each of the documents and moved some of it into the gutenberg css file that I made.
I also provided the following link in each of the gutenberg html file <link rel="stylesheet" href="gutenberg.css">
I also changed the title of each of the documents to the following three names (Gutenberg Three Anne of green gables, Gutenberg Two The Odyssey, Gutenberg One Anna Karenina)
I also provided a link to the old paper background that I am using. You can see this at the top of each gutenberg document.

CITATIONS
=================
Note: My gutenberg css is derived from the css already given in the three books I used. The thre books I used were the odyssey, Anne of green gables and Anna Karenina
